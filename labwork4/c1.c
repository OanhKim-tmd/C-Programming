/*Exercise 1:
Write a function in C to find the greatest common divisor (gcd) of two positive integer
numbers.
Exercise 2:
Use the gcd function in the previous exercise to find the greatest common divisor of four
positive integer numbers.
Exercise 3:
Write two C functions that compute f(x)=2.5x and g(x,y)=xy
Exervise 4:
Write a C function to enter a positive integer number and calculate n! using recursive
function.
Exercise 5:
Write two C functions to calculate xn , n and x are input from the keyboard by the normal function and recursive function.
Note: All the functions should be defined in two separated files: *.h and *.c*/
